[> Blender NDS exporter:

Are you developping a 3D app for the Nintendo DS?
Are you using Blender to create astonishing 3D meshes?
This script extends Blender to export easily your meshes into NDS binary "GL-like" CallLists.

[> Install:

Note to former users: PIL is not needed anymore to export textures coordinates 
but this means also the texture will not be exported into PCX anymore.

Copy the script "nds_3d_export.py" into the "scripts" directory of Blender:
 Linux/Mac : $(HOME)/.blender/scripts
 Windows : ??? (I do not really know since I'm not using Windows ...)

Note: Starting with blender 2.5, there is a function in Python located at 
bpy.utils.script_paths() that show possible paths.

Run Blender and check the File > Export menu : you'll find a new entry called "Nintendo DS CallList".

[> Changelog:

v0.1:
    UV-textured meshes + Normals + Colors.
    Export into "C-style" format.
    Export Texture into PCX Format with correct size.
v0.2:
    Export into "Binary" format.
TODO :
    - 3D Animation support
    - Export directly into binary format
