[> Blender NDS exporter:

Are you developping a 3D app for the Nintendo DS?
Are you using Blender to create astonishing 3D meshes?
This script allow you to export easily your Blender meshes into NDS binary "GL-like" CallLists.

[> Install:

Before running the script with Blender , you must have the "Python Imaging Library" installed.
For Debian/Ubuntu systems : aptitude install python-imaging
For Windows : Download and install "Python Imaging Library" from website "www.pythonware.com/products/pil"

Copy the script "nds_3d_export.py" into the "scripts" directory of Blender:
 Linux/Mac : $(HOME)/.blender/scripts
 Windows : ??? (I do not really know since I'm not using Windows ...)

Run Blender and check the File > Export menu : you'll find a new entry called "Nintendo DS CallList".
